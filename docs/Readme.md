\# Documentation



\### Original



While the pdf's that the project puts out are very well put together they lack key information and are not well suited to the build process or the revision process. The author makes changes without producing a change log, sometimes changing key information. It s sort of funny that these files will not open with Adobe, I had to open them with Firefox and then print them to a PDF to open them with Adobe so I could compare the changes. This is not a fun way to do this but I think the project needs to do a better job with the versioning and documentation, some of the information removed is key to the project and there is quite a bit of missing or incorrect information.



\### Extracted


!WIP I extracted the LONG pdf files and put them into o and s folders. o is for the old doc and s is the current. I didn't have time to finish going through them, but the o folder has some pages that were removed from the current docs. I hope to eventually finish digging through them and combining them with the web site doc and finally they should be matched up with the models so you can quickly look at the parts that are being explained. !TODO WIP


NOTEs: The printable frame information was removed, and it looks like they settled on the so called ultimate frame. I think this is because the E3NG project has a major flaw with all the corners being printed and therefore subject to no good alignment. The maintainers new project seems to correct this and gets rid of most of the 3d printed parts used in squaring the frame. However with a 3d printed gantry this point is moot since that will also have issues. The revised gantry has several problems compared to the old gantry such as easy of disassembly.



Also if you are going to be printing the bottom skirts you might as well ignore pages 19-20 and 23.



The  Electronics section was so bad I didn't bother to compare.
