# SOURCING PARTS
{: .text-center }

While the **"S"** version was designed to simplify the process by offering a prepared set of parts, this is not possible with the Advanced version. Although the printer base might be similar, each configuration will result in a slightly different final Bill of Materials. The best way to source the parts is to do it manually.

To help with sourcing, you can still check out the available **[KITS]** for the **"S"** version which include some partial packages that may cover most of what you need, offering the advantages of kit pricing and quality. You could even start with a full kit and customize it to suit your requirements.

You'll find all the necessary parts listed in the [configurator's] Bill of Materials. Be sure to pay attention to product quantities, and read the notes and specifications carefully—including required parameters such as dimensions, quality etc.

All linked products have been selected based on our testing, seller reliability, and pricing. That means if you use the recommended links, you'll get parts with a good price-to-performance ratio—where critical components prioritize quality, and others focus on affordability.
